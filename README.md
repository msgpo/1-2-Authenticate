1-2-Authenticate is an app for two factor authentication using open standards developed by
the [Initiative for Open Authentication (OATH)](http://www.openauthentication.org/).

This implementation supports the HMAC-Based One-time Password (HOTP) algorithm
specified in [RFC 4226](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226) and the Time-based
One-time Password (TOTP) algorithm specified in [RFC 6238](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238).

This app is a modified version of the open source version of the Google Authenicator app (Copyright 2010 Google Inc.), which can be found [here](https://github.com/google/google-authenticator-android).
